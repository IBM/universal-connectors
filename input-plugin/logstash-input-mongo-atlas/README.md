# Mongo Atlas-Guardium Logstash input plug-in
### Meet Mongo Atlas
* Tested versions: 1.0.1
* Developed by IBM
* Configuration instructions can be found on [Guardium Mongo Atlas documentation](https://github.com/IBM/universal-connectors/blob/main/input-plugin/logstash-input-mongo-atlas/README.md)
* Supported Guardium versions:
    * Guardium Data Protection: 11.4 and above
    * Guardium Insights: coming soon

This is a [Logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash) input plug-in for the universal connector that is featured in IBM Security Guardium. It reads events and messages from the Mongo Atlas audit log into a [Guardium record](https://github.com/IBM/universal-connectors/blob/main/common/src/main/java/com/ibm/guardium/universalconnector/commons/structures/Record.java) instance (which is a standard structure made out of several parts). The information is then sent over to Guardium. Guardium records include the accessor (the person who tried to access the data), the session, data, and exceptions. If there are no errors, the data contains details about the query "construct". The construct details the main action (verb) and collections (objects) involved.

In order to support a few features one zip has to be added with the name "guardium_logstash-offline-plugins-mongo-atlas.zip".

##  Configuring the Input Mongo Atlas plugin in Guardium
### Before you begin
  • You must have permissions for the S-TAP Management role. The admin user includes this role by default.
## Authorizing outgoing traffic from Mongo atlas to Guardium
  1. Log in to the Guardium API.
  2. Issue these command:
    • grdapi add_domain_to_universal_connector_allowed_domains domain=cloud.mongodb.com
## Procedure
  1. On the collector, go to Setup > Tools and Views > Configure Universal Connector.
  2. Enable the Guardium Universal Connector if is in disabled state before uploading the UC plug-in.
  3. Click Upload File and select the offline [logstash-input-mongo_atlas_input.zip](https://github.com/IBM/universal-connectors/releases/download/v1.5.0/logstash-input-mongo_atlas_input.zip) plug-in. After it is uploaded, click OK.This is not necessary for Guardium Data Protection v12.0 and later.
  4. Click the Plus sign to open the Connector Configuration dialog box.
  5. Type a name in the Connector name field.
  6. Update the input section to add the details from the https://github.com/IBM/universal-connectors/blob/main/input-plugin/logstash-input-mongo-atlas/input-mongo-atlas.conf file input section, omitting the keyword "input{" at the beginning and its corresponding "}" at the end.
  7. Update the filter section to add the details from the https://github.com/IBM/universal-connectors/blob/main/input-plugin/logstash-input-mongo-atlas/input-mongo-atlas.conf file filter section, omitting the keyword "filter{" at the beginning and its corresponding "}" at the end.
  8. 'type' field should match in input and filter configuration section.This field should be unique for every individual connector added.
  9. Click Save. Guardium validates the new connector, and enables the universal connector if it was disabled. After it is validated, it appears in the Configure Universal Connector page.

### Example
### mongo  event
  { "atype" : "authCheck", "ts" : { "$date" : "2022-07-03T10:05:49.906+00:00" }, "uuid" : { "$binary" : "Y2etnPUqSgayglUyJEIhAg==", "$type" : "04" }, "local" : { "ip" : "192.168.240.160", "port" : 27017 }, "remote" : { "ip" : "192.168.240.160", "port" : 35154 }, "users" : [ { "user" : "mms-automation", "db" : "admin" } ], "roles" : [ { "role" : "restore", "db" : "admin" }, { "role" : "userAdminAnyDatabase", "db" : "admin" }, { "role" : "dbAdminAnyDatabase", "db" : "admin" }, { "role" : "backup", "db" : "admin" }, { "role" : "readWriteAnyDatabase", "db" : "admin" }, { "role" : "clusterAdmin", "db" : "admin" } ], "param" : { "command" : "find", "ns" : "local.clustermanager", "args" : { "find" : "clustermanager", "filter" : {}, "limit" : { "$numberLong" : "1" }, "singleBatch" : true, "sort" : {}, "lsid" : { "id" : { "$binary" : "ij8ekCWaRSmm4kJmrXMVrA==", "$type" : "04" } }, "$clusterTime" : { "clusterTime" : { "$timestamp" : { "t" : 1656842749, "i" : 1 } }, "signature" : { "hash" : { "$binary" : "DO6s7IXc/4pDtTLFqcVl58O/uaI=", "$type" : "00" }, "keyId" : { "$numberLong" : "7109460176817618948" } } }, "$db" : "local", "$readPreference" : { "mode" : "primaryPreferred" } } }, "result" : 0 }


## Supported audit messages & commands
* authCheck: 
    * find, insert, delete, update, create, drop, etc.
    * aggregate with $lookup(s) or $graphLookup(s)
    * applyOps: An internal command that can be triggered manually to create or drop collection. The command object is written as "\[json-object\]" in Guardium. Details are included in the Guardium Full SQL field, if available. 
* authenticate (with error only) 

Notes: 
* For the events to be handled propertly: 
    * MongoDB access control must be set, as messages without users are removed. 
    * authCheck and authenticate events should not be filtered out of the MongoDB audit log messages.
* Other MongoDB events and messages are removed from the pipeline, since their data is already parsed in the authCheck message.
* Non-MongoDB events are skipped, but not removed from the pipeline, since they may be used by other filter plug-ins.

##  Supported errors

* Authentication error (18) – A failed login error.
* Authorization error (13) - To see the "Unauthorized ..." description in Guardium, you must extend the report and add the "Exception description" field.

The filter plug-in also supports sending errors. For this, MongoDB access control must be configured before the events will be logged. For example, edit _/etc/mongod.conf_ so that it includes:

    security:  
        authorization: enabled

##  Limitations
* There is no support for client hostname
* IPv6 addresses are typically supported by the MongoDB and filter plug-ins, however this is not fully supported by the Guardium pipeline.
* 'Source Program' is left blank.
* For system generated queries, 'Server Host Name' & 'Client Host Name' are seen same.
* Mentioned 'Audit filter criteria on MongoDB' captures all the events. Customer should set it as per their need to avoid unnecessary logs.
