#### Configure the DynamoDB filters in Guardium

##### Before you begin

You must have permission for the S-Tap Management role. The admin user has this role by default.

#### About this task

The Guardium univer***REMOVED***l connector is the Guardium entry point for native audit logs. The univer***REMOVED***l connector identifies and parses received events, and then converts them to a standard Guardium format. The output of the univer***REMOVED***l connector is forwarded to the Guardium sniffer on the collector, for policy and auditing enforcements. Configure Guardium to read the native audit logs by customizing the DynamoDB template.

Supported events:

- UpdateTable event
- CreateTable event
- DescribeTable event
- ListTables event
- DeleteTable event
- Error event

##### Procedure

1.	On the collector, go to ```Setup``` > ```Tools and Views``` > ```Configure Univer***REMOVED***l Connector``` to open the Connector Configuration dialog box.
2.	From the Connector template menu, select the offline logstash-offline-plugins-7.5.2.zip plug-in.
3.	Type a name in the Connector name field.
4.	Modify the input section to look like this :

	      cloudwatch_logs {
				#Mandatory arguments:
				log_group => ["aws-dynamodb-logs"]
				access_key_id => "<insert_access_key>"
				secret_access_key => "<insert_access_secret"
			region => "ap-south-1" #Default value: us-east-1
				start_position => "end"
				interval => 5
				event_filter => ""
				type => "Dynamodb"
		      }
		
where log_group is the log group that is created for the data instance (for example, ```"aws-dynamodb-logs"```).

5.	Update the filter section to look like this:
					
       if [type] == "Dynamodb" {
			json {
					source => "mes***REMOVED***ge"
					target => "parsed_json"
				}
				mutate {
					add_field => {
						"new_event_source" => "%{[parsed_json][eventSource]}"
					}
				}
				if [new_event_source] {
					if[new_event_source] =~ "dynamodb.amazonaws.com" {
						dynamodb_guardium_plugin_filter {}
					}
					else {
 					drop {}
					}
				}

				mutate { remove_field => [ "parsed_json", "new_event_source", "mes***REMOVED***ge", "cloudwatch_logs", "@timestamp", "@version", "type", "host", "sequence" ] }
			}

	IMPORTANT: Delete the lines:  
			output {
				stdout { codec => rubydebug }
		}


6. Click Save. Guardium validates the new connector, and enables the univer***REMOVED***l connector if it was di***REMOVED***bled. After it is validated, the connector appears in the Configure Univer***REMOVED***l Connector page.
 
## Configuring Amazon S3 auditing with CloudWatch

CloudTrail monitors S3 activity in your Amazon account. Configure CloudTrail with Cloud Watch so that Guardium can pull the info from CloudWatch into the Guardium collector and analyze it.

### About this task
Configuring Amazon S3 auditing to send files to Cloud Watch (and then on to the Guardium Univer***REMOVED***l Connector) using CloudTrail links your Amazon S3 or AWS account with Guardium. Begin by turning on your univer***REMOVED***l connector, then complete the steps in this procedure.

#### Procedure

1.	Complete the procedure below for **Configuring Amazon AWS CloudTrail to send log files to CloudWatch**. This procedure is for all users, so Guardium can monitor events from their Amazon account.

2.	Then, follow one of the procedures listed below. Choose the one that describes your current account setup.

- If you want to connect to CloudWatch directly from Guardium outside AWS, follow this procedure: **Configuring security credentials for your AWS user account**.

- If you access CloudWatch from the ***REMOVED***me AWS account as the EC2 hosting Guardium, follow this procedure: **Configuring IAM role for CloudWatch integration**.

- If you access CloudWatch from a separate AWS account, follow this procedure: **Configuring AWS security credentials for cross-account CloudWatch integration that uses a configuration with role_arn**.

### Configuring security credentials for your AWS user account

#### Before you begin

You must have your AWS user account access key and the secret access key values before you can configure a log source in Univer***REMOVED***l Connector.

#### Procedure
1.	Log in to your IAM console
2.	Select ```Users``` from the left navigation panel and then select your user name from the list.
3.	Click the ```Security Credentials``` tab.
4.	In the ```Access Keys``` section, click the ```Create access``` key.
5.	From the window that displays after the access key and corresponding secret access key are created, download the .csv file that contains the keys or copy and ***REMOVED***ve the keys.

***Note: Save the Access key ID and Secret access key and use them when you configure a log source in Univer***REMOVED***l Connector.***

***Note: You can view the Secret access key only after it is created.***
 
### Configuring IAM role for CloudWatch integration

#### Before you begin

In the Amazon UI, create and ***REMOVED***ve the IAM role. You use it when you configure a univer***REMOVED***l connector.

#### Procedure
1.	Log in to your IAM console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).
2.	Select ```AWS service``` as ```Trusted entity type``` and ```EC2``` as a use case.
3.	Select ```Roles``` in the left-hand navigation and then create a new IAM role that has CloudWatchLogsFullAccess and STS:full access permissions.
4.	Go to the Elastic Computing (EC2) instance page that hosts the collector and assign to it the IAM role that you created.

#### Results
That IAM role that you created will be used to configure the connector in role_arn (no access key ID or secret access key will be needed).

### Configuring AWS security credentials for cross-account CloudWatch integration that uses a configuration with role_arn

When you are using two AWS accounts, use the following configuration: a Guardium hosted on an EC2 account and a CloudWatch account.

#### Before you begin
This procedure assumes that:
•	The CloudWatch account number is 2222.
•	The Guardium on EC2 account number is 1111 and the ec2 instance id is i-01111.
•	The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) role assigned to the EC2 account is:
```arn:aws:iam::1111:role/ec2_only_assign_role_to2222```

***Note: If that role does not exist, create it and assign it to the EC2 instance.***

#### Procedure
1.	Create a role named ```ec2_read_loggorups_from_1111``` for the CloudWatch account (2222).

- Restrict access by using one of the following methods:
 - Add the policy ```CloudWatchLogsReadOnlyAccess``` to that role and an inline policy that eliminates access to all groups except ```npDemoGroup```.

	       {
                  "Version": "2012-10-17",
	             "Statement": {
	                  "Effect": "Deny",
	                  "Action": "*",
	                  "NotResource": [
	                      "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:2222:log-group:npDemoGroup:*"
	                     ]

	          }
            }

 - Use an inline policy so the role can read logs only on the resource arn:```aws:logs:us-east-1:2222:log-group:npDemoGroup:*```.


	     {
	           "Version": "2012-10-17",
	           "Statement": [
	               {
	                  "Action": [
	                     "logs:Describe*",
	                     "logs:Get*",
	                     "logs:List*",
	                     "logs:StartQuery",
	                     "logs:StopQuery",
	                     "logs:TestMetricFilter",
	                     "logs:FilterLogEvents"
	                  ],
	                  "Effect": "Allow",
	                  "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:2222:log-group:npDemoGroup:*"	                  }
	              ]
	     }

2.	Add a trust policy to ```ec2_read_loggorups_from_1111``` to trust the role on the other account (1111) that is assigned to the ec2 that hosts Guardium.



	     {
	               "Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
	{
	"Effect": "Allow",
	"Principal": {
	     "AWS”:“arn:aws:sts:: 1111:assumed-role/ ec2_only_assign_role_to2222/i-01111"
	},
	  "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
	},
	        {
	            "Sid": "Allow",
	            "Effect": "Allow",
	            "Principal": {
	                "AWS": "arn:aws:sts:: 1111:assumed-role/ ec2_only_assign_role_to2222/i-
	01111"
	            },
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
	        }
	]
	     }


In this example, the ARN of the created role is: ```arn:aws:iam::2222:role/ec2_read_loggorups_from_1111```

3. 	Add a trust policy to the role in the Guardium on EC2 account (1111) that is assigned to EC2. In this example, the role is: ```arn:aws:iam::1111:role/ec2_only_assign_role_to2222```.

	       {
	       {
       	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	       "Statement": [
       	{
       	"Effect": "Allow",
       	"Principal": {
	         "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
       	},
         	"Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
	        }
     	  ]
       	}

And add this inline policy:


       {
           "Version": "2012-10-17",
           "Statement": [
             {
                "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
                "Resource": [
                     "arn:aws:iam::2222:role/ec2_read_loggorups_from_1111"
                   ]
                 }
            ]
     }

4 .	Set the input configuration for CloudWatch in the univer***REMOVED***l connector where role_arn is ```arn:aws:iam::2222:role/ec2_read_loggorups_from_1111``` and log_group is ```npDemoGroup```. The log group is from the CloudWatch account (2222).

	cloudwatch_logs {
	                  start_position => "end"
	                  interval => 5
	                  log_group => [ "npDemoGroup" ]



	                  role_arn => "arn:aws:iam::2222:role/ec2_read_loggorups_from_1111"
	                      # like "AK7VU3RZIA6LUS2AOLSU"

	                region => "us-east-1"
	                   # like "us-east-1"

	               event_filter => '{$.eventSource="s3.amazonaws.com"}'
	                   # for filtering also based on bucket name use event_filter =>
	                   '{$.eventSource="s3.amazonaws.com" && $.requestParameters.bucketName= "<BUCKET_NAME>"}'
	                     type => "S3"
    }

## Configuring Amazon S3 auditing via SQS
