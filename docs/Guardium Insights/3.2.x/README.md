# Guardium Insights 3.2.x
The Universal Connector uses plug-in to the datasource server.

There are [available plugins](../../../docs/available_plugins.md) that are ready for connecting the data source to Guardium Insights.

In cases where the requested data source isn't available, please refer tp [Developing a plug-in](../../../docs/Guardium%20Insights/3.2.x/developing_plugins_gi.md).

Please refer to [Managing plug-ins](../../../docs/Guardium%20Insights/3.2.x/Plugins_management.md) to make sure the required plug-in is installed before configuring a new universal connector.

Once the plug-in is installed you can [create a new connection](../../../docs/Guardium%20Insights/3.2.x/UC_Configuration_GI.md). 

The connection initialization can take few minutes, to monitor the current status of connection and the latest traffic click [here](../../../docs/Guardium%20Insights/3.2.x/monitoring_GI.MD).
