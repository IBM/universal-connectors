# Guardium Data Protection 

The Guardium universal connector enables Guardium Data Protection to get data from potentially any data source's native activity logs without using software taps (S-TAPs- the software agent usually used in Guardium). The universal connector includes support for various plug-in packages, requiring minimal configuration. You can easily develop plug-ins for other data sources and install them in Guardium.
## Procedure

1. There are a number of available plugins that can connect various data sources to Guardium Data Protection. Select a plug-in from [this](/docs/available_plugins.md)  list of available plug-ins and follow the procedure written for the plug-in of your choice. 

    a. If the data source you want isn't on the list, you can [create your own plug-in](/docs/Guardium%20Data%20Protection/developing_plugins_gdp.md).

2. Once the plug-in is installed, you can [create a new connection](/docs/Guardium%20Data%20Protection/uc_config_gdp.md). 

3. The connection initialization can take few minutes. To monitor the current status of connection and the latest traffic, click [here](/docs/Guardium%20Data%20Protection/monitoring_GDP.md).
