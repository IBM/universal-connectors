# Configuring GIM to handle Filebeat and Syslog on MongoDB

You can use the GIM client, which is installed on your database,
to manage native log audit forwarding by using Filebeat and Syslog.

•	**Configuring the GIM client to handle Filebeat and Syslog on MongoDB**

You can configure the Filebeat and Syslog native log audit on MongoDB data sources
by installing the GIM client on the MongoDB, and configuring the GIM parameters in the Setup by Client page.

•	**Installing the GIM client by using shell on Unix, and configuring Filebeat and Syslog on MongoDB by using GIM**

You can install the ```GIM BUNDLE-GUC``` by script on the Unix database server,
and then continue by configuring the Guardium univer***REMOVED***l connector in the Set up by Client page.

•	**Creating a filter for MongoDB activity audit log by using the API**

The groups in the API `schedule_generate_mongo_filter_job` are used to continuously update
the value of the GIM parameter ```GUC_AUDIT_LOG_FILTER```. The GIM parameter specifies which events to include
in the data that is forwarded to the Guardium univer***REMOVED***l connector. This task describes creating and
populating the groups, and running the API.

## Configuring the GIM client to handle Filebeat and Syslog on MongoDB

You can configure the Filebeat and Syslog native log audit on MongoDB data sources by installing the
 GIM client on the MongoDB, and configuring the GIM parameters in the Setup by Client page.
Before you begin

•	Obtain the GIM client from either [Fix Central](https://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/), or your
Guardium representative. The bundle name has the format BUNDLE-GUC.

•	The GIM bundles must be uploaded and imported to the Guardium system. See [Uploading and
importing GIM modules](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/guardium/11.5?topic=gim-uploading-importing-modules).

About this task

You can either update the configuration immediately and restart the database, or ***REMOVED***ve the configuration to a
temporary mongod.conf file on the database. The parameter ```GUC_RESTART_DB``` controls the restart.
See the [parameter description](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/guardium/11.4?topic=mongodb-configuring-gim-client-handle-filebeat-syslog#task_btt_z11_2nb__GUC_RESTART_DB).
(You can also install the GIM bundle on Linux servers by using the shell.
See Installing the GIM client by using shell on Unix, and configuring Filebeat and Syslog on MongoDB by using GIM below.)

Procedure

1. Install the GIM client on your data sources.
For UNIX, use GUC GIM package guard-bundle-GUC-11.4.0.0_r111103_v11_4_1-rhel-8-linux-x86_64.gim.
 For Windows, the package name is guard-GUC-11.4_r110400183_1-x86_x64.gim
 (These package names are examples for version 11.4. More package names can be found on [Fix Central](https://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/)). For more information, see [Installing the GIM client on a Windows server](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/guardium/11.5?topic=servers-installing-gim-client-windows-server), and [Installing the GIM client on a UNIX server](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/guardium/11.5?topic=servers-installing-gim-client-unix-server).

2. In the Setup by Client page, install the Guardium univer***REMOVED***l connector bundle on the data sources.
(See the description of the Setup by Client page options in [Set up by Client](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/guardium/11.5?topic=gim-set-up-by-client).)

a.	In the ```Choose bundle``` section of the Setup by Client page,
select the bundle: ```BUNDLE-GUC (<release number>)```. To see bundles for Windows, leave the ```“show only bundles”``` checkbox cleared.

b.	Set the ```GUC_GUARD_HOSTS``` parameter, which is required for installation.

  **Note: If you want to install Filebeat on your data source, set ```GUC_INSTALL_FILEBEAT``` to ```1```
  during installation, but not during the update.**

  **Note: You can update optional configuration parameters from
  paragraph section ```GIM GUC Client configuration update``` during GUC client installation or later,
   GUC client during configuration update.**

  **Note: If you installed Filebeat using ```PARAMETER GUC_INSTALL_FILEBEAT=1```,
  all changes of Filebeat-related parameters, marked in the table as “filebeat only” causes the Filebeat service to restart.
  If you don’t install Filebeat, all changes of Filebeat-related parameters require manual Filebeat service restart.**

## Installing the GIM client by using shell on Unix, and configuring Filebeat and Syslog on MongoDB by using GIM

You can install the ```GIM BUNDLE-GUC``` by script on the Unix database server, and then continue by configuring the Guardium univer***REMOVED***l connector in the Set up by Client page.
Before you begin
•	Obtain the correct Guardium univer***REMOVED***l connector installer script, from either [Fix Central](https://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/), or your Guardium representative. The script name identifies the database server operating system. The GUC shell installation package name is in the format: ```guard-bundle-GUC-11.3.0.0_r109603_v11_3_1-rhel-7-linux-x86_64.gim.sh```, where the first three numbers are the release number, followed by the revision number, in this example r109603.

### Procedure

1.	Log in to the database server as root user and copy the GIM bundle for Guardium univer***REMOVED***l connector to ```/tmp```.
2.	Change the directory to ```/tmp``` folder.
Run this command, for example:
```
# ../guard-bundle-GUC-11.4.0.0_r111103_v11_4_1-rhel-8-linux-x86_64.gim.sh -- --dir /usr/local/IBM --tapip  9.46.90.173 --sqlguardip 9.55.247.248 --perl /usr/bin --guc_guard_hosts 9.55.247.248_5044 -q

4.	Repeat step 3 to configure more connectors.


## Creating a filter for MongoDB activity audit log by using the API

The groups in the API ```schedule_generate_mongo_filter_job``` are used to continuously update the value of the GIM parameter ```GUC_AUDIT_LOG_FILTER```.

The GIM parameter specifies which events to include in the data that is forwarded to the Guardium univer***REMOVED***l connector. This task describes creating and populating the groups, and running the API.

### About this task

Each group specifies either a command, user group, or object. Each activity on the MongoDB is compared to these groups. If an activity matches a definition in any one of the groups, the specific activity is forwarded to the Guardium univer***REMOVED***l connector. Each group is evaluated independently. A match to any one group means that the activity is forwarded.

**Note: To apply an updated ```GUC_AUDIT_LOG_FILTER``` parameter to a working mongo configuration, you need to restart the mongo database. Set GIM GUC bundle configuration parameter ```GUC_RESTART_DB=1``` and run an install update via the GIM GUI.**

### Procedure

1.	Create groups for the API parameter ```usersGroupId```.

a.	Go to ```Setup``` > ```Tools and Views``` > ```Group Builder```.

b.	Click the plus icon to open the Create new group dialog.

c.	Give the group an identifiable group name, like API_UsersGroup-1.

d.	For Application type, select Classifier.

e.	For Group type, select a group type with tuple of two fields in the format ```<field-1>/<field-2>```. For example, ```Server IP/DB User```. You can choose any Group type that has the format
``` <field-1>/<field-2>```.
2.	Add members to the group.

a.	In the Members tab, click the plus icon  to open the Add member dialog.

b.	Enter the database name in the first field, and the DB username in the second field, and click ```OK```. Repeat for more members.

3.	Click Save.

4.	Repeat steps 1, 2, and 3 to create more user groups.

5.	Identify the group IDs. From the CLI command line, run the command ```grdapi list_group_by_desc desc="<group name>"``` once for each of the groups you created in step 1-3.

6.	Create groups for the API parameter ```commandGroupId```.

a.	Repeat step 1 using names that indicate command groups, for example, ```API_commands_1```, ```API_commands_2```.

b.	Add members to the new groups. Enter the database name in the first field, and the conman name in the second field.

7.	Identify the group IDs. From the CLI command line, run the command ```grdapi list_group_by_desc desc="<group name>"``` once for each of the groups you created in step 6.

8.	Create groups for the API parameter ```objectsGroupId```.

a.	Repeat step 1 using names that indicate command groups, for example, ```API_objects_1```, ```API_objects_2```.

b.	Add members to the new groups. Enter the database name in the first field, and the object name in the second field.

9.	Identify the group IDs. From the CLI command line, run the command ```grdapi list_group_by_desc desc="<group name>"``` once for each of the groups you created in step 8.

10.	Run the command ```grdapi schedule_generate_mongo_filter_job```. For example, with the groups IDs

```
grdapi schedule_generate_mongo_filter_job clientIp="n.n.n.n"
usersGroupId="100,101" objectsGroupId="104,105"
commandGroupId="201,202" cronStr="0 15 0 * * ? *"
```

11.	In the Guardium GUI, open the ```Scheduled Jobs``` page. The new job MongoFilterGeneratorJob appears in waiting status.

### Results
The audit log is filtered for anything that does not match the group definitions, by default, starting at 00:15 the following night.
