3. Clone or download the [example plugin project][logstash-filter-mongodb-guardium] 
2. Within your plugin project, create _gradle.properties_ and add a reference to the folder with the built JAR files. For example: 

    GUARDIUM_UNIVERSALCONNECTOR_COMMONS_PATH=../guardium-universalconnector-commons/build/libs
    
The GUARDIUM_UNIVERSALCONNECTOR_COMMONS_PATH variable is used in _build.gradle_, when compiling and building the code in your plugin project.
