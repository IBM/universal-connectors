## Overview

The Universal Connector framework assists data security teams by providing an agentless method for collecting activity and auditing log data from a variety of cloud and on-premise data sources. The framework:
- Is easy to set up and configure.
- Is simple to maintain.
- Normalizes collected data, making it consumable for security applications.

Important note: Only the plug-ins that appear in verifiedUCPlugins.txt are supported in Guardium Insights. The rest are only supported in Guardium Data Protection (GDP).

## How it works
The Universal Connectors consist of a series of three plug-ins within a [Logstash pipeline](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/pipeline.html) that ingest, filter, and output events in a normalized, common format:

1) **Input plug-in**: Settings to pull events from APIs or receive push of events.
2) **Filter plug-in**: Parses, filters, and modifies events into a common format.
3) **Output plug-in**: Sends normalized events to locations to be consumed by security applications.

Universal Connector plug-ins are packaged and deployed in a Docker container environment.

## Using Universal Connector plug-ins
- [In Guardium Data Protection](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/guardium/11.4?topic=connector-configuring-guardium-universal).
- [In Guardium Insights](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/guardium-insights/3.0.x?topic=connector-configuring-universal).

## Packaging Guardium Insights Universal Connector plug-ins
Note: Pre-packaged plug-ins can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/IBM/universal-connectors/releases)
1) **Clone universal-connectors project**: git clone https://github.com/IBM/universal-connectors.git
2) **Enter universal-connector project folder**: cd /path/to/universal-connectors
3) **Run packagePluginsForGuardiumInsights.sh script**: sh packagePluginsForGuardiumInsights.sh
4) **Find required plug-ins in packagedPlugins**: ls packagedPlugins

## Creating custom Universal Connector plug-ins
- [Configuring native audit on the data source](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/guardium/11.4?topic=ins-configuring-native-audit-data-source)
- [Developing a filter plug-in](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/guardium/11.4?topic=ins-developing-filter-plug-in)
- [Create](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/input-new-plugin.html) or use an [existing (recommended)](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/input-plugins.html) input plugin
- [Testing a filter plug-in in a development environment](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/guardium/11.4?topic=ins-testing-filter-in-dev-environment)
- [Installing and testing the filter or input plug-in on a staging Guardium system](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/guardium/11.4?topic=dpi-installing-testing-filter-input-plug-in-staging-guardium-system)

Note: To package a plug-in for Guardium Insights, you need to include additional files, in this structure: 

    datasourceManifest.json
    config.json
    lang_en.json
    /YourPluginNamePackage
      |_  filter.conf
      |_  your-filter-offline-plugin.zip
      |_ manifest.json # details ...

* _datasourceManifest.json_: Specifies the input and filter names (when installed on Logstash), as well as the supported platforms ("on-premise", "AWS", "Azure", "GCP", or a new platform of your choice).
* config.json: Contains parameters that are completed by Guardium Insights users.
* lang_en.json: Describes the parameters.
* YourPluginNamePackage folder contains:
  * filter.conf: A validated Logstash filter configuration (could also be an input, but usually a filter), with parameters names as placeholders. These values will be replaced by user input, according to the input fields you specified in config.json.
  * your-filter-offline-plugin.zip: A Logstash offline plug-in package. This is the plug-in you created for GDP (see links above for instructions).
  * manifest.json: Describes the plug-in type ("filter" or "input"), its mechanism ("push" or "pull"), as well as the id/name of the plug-in after it is installed on Logstash, supported data source(s), and other valuable meta-data.


## Contributing
To make your connector plug-in available to the community, submit your connector to this repository for IBM Certification. We also accept updates or bug fixes to existing plug-ins, to keep them current:

- [Guidelines for contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Benefits include:
  - Free, comprehensive testing and certification.
  - Expanding the reach of product APIs.
  - Driving usage of a product or solution.
