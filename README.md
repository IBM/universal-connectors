## Overview

The Universal Connector framework assists data security teams by providing a method to agentlessly collect activity and audit log data from a variety cloud and on-premise data sources.
- Easy to setup and configure
- Simple to maintain
- Normalizes collected data - making it consumable for security applications

An important note: only the plug-ins which appear in verifiedUCPlugins.txt are supported in Guardium Insights. The rest are only supported in Guardium GDP.

## How it works
Universal Connectors consist of series of three plugins within a [Logstash pipeline](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/pipeline.html) that ingest, filter, and output events in a normalized, common format:

1) **Input Plugin**: Settings to pull events from APIs or receive push of events.
2) **Filter Plugin**: Parses, filters, and modifies events into a common format.
3) **Output Plugin**: Sends normalized events to locations to be consumed by security applications.

Universal Connector plugins are packaged and deployed in a Docker container environment.
