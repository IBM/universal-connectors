# MariaDB-Guardium Logstash filter plug-in
### Meet MariaDB
* Tested versions: 10.6
* Environment: On-premise, Iaas
* Supported inputs: Filebeat (push)
* Supported Guardium versions:
    * Guardium Data Protection: 11.4 and above
    * Guardium Insights: 3.2
    * Guardium Insights: 1.0

This is a [Logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash) filter plug-in for the universal connector that is featured in IBM Security Guardium. It parses events and messages from the MariaDB audit log into a [Guardium record](https://github.com/IBM/universal-connectors/blob/main/common/src/main/java/com/ibm/guardium/universalconnector/commons/structures/Record.java) instance (which is a standard structure made out of several parts). The information is then sent over to Guardium. Guardium records include the accessor (the person who tried to access the data), the session, data, and exceptions. If there are no errors, the data contains details about the query and Guardium sniffer parse the MariaDB queries. The MariaDB plugin supports only Guardium Data Protection as of now.

The plug-in is free and open-source (Apache 2.0). It can be used as a starting point to develop additional filter plug-ins for Guardium universal connector.


## Enabling the audit logs

### Procedure:
1. To install MariaDB Audit Plugin execute the INSTALL command
``` 
INSTALL SONAME 'server_audit’;
```
[Click Here](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-audit-plugin-installation/) for learn more about audit plugin

2. To check the list of audit plugin-related variables on the server and their values, execute the command while connected to the server
```
 SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'server_audit%';
 ```
3. Once the plugin installed, set server_audit_logging=ON​ in vim /etc/my.cnf file to enable the audit log in MariaDB.

## 3. Viewing the audit logs
To view audit logs goto Location -/var/lib/mysql/*.log

### Supported audit messages types
Default event types configure in MariaDB are Connect,Query and Table. User can update  these value by executing "SET GLOBAL server_audit_events" command. [MariaDB LogSettings](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-audit-plugin-log-settings/)

```

mariadb> SET GLOBAL server_audit_events= 'CONNECT,QUERY,TABLE';	
mariadb> SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'server_aduit%';

+-------------------------------+-----------------------+
| Variable_name                 | Value                 |
+-------------------------------+-----------------------+
| server_audit_events           | CONNECT,QUERY,TABLE   |
```
## 4. Configuring Filebeat to push logs to Guardium

## a. Filebeat installation

### Procedure:
 
  To install Filebeat on your system, follow the steps in this topic:
    https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-installation-configuration.html#installation

## b. Filebeat configuration:

To use Logstash to perform additional processing on the data collected by Filebeat, we need to configure Filebeat to use Logstash. To do this, modify the filebeat.yml file which you can find inside the folder where filebeat is installed. Follow these instructions for finding the installation directory:
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/directory-layout.html

### Procedure:

1. Configuring the input section :-

    • Locate "filebeat.inputs" in the filebeat.yml file, then add the following parameters. 
```
    filebeat.inputs:
       - type: log   
       enabled: true
        paths:
       -/var/lib/mysql/*.log
       exclude_lines: ["select 1","SET autocommit","select @@version_comment","SHOW COLLATION","SELECT @@tx_isolation","select @@lower_case_table_names","SET GLOBAL","SHOW GLOBAL","COMMIT","ROLLBACK","SELECT CONCAT","FLUSH PRIVILEGES","set @@SQL_SELECT_LIMIT","SELECT TABLE_SCHEMA TABLE_CAT","@@max_allowed_packet"]
       tags: ["MariaDB_On_Premise"]
```
2. Configuring the output section:
```
    • Locate "output" in the filebeat.yml file, then add the following parameters.

    • Disable Elasticsearch output by commenting it out.

    • Enable Logstash output by uncommenting the Logstash section. For more information, see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/logstash-output.html#logstash-output
```
For example:
  ```
       output.logstash:
       hosts: ["127.0.0.1:8541"]

    • The hosts option specifies the Logstash server and the port (8541) where Logstash is configured to listen for incoming Beats connections.

    •You can set any port number except 5044, 5141, and 5000 (as these are currently reserved in Guardium v11.3 and v11.4 ).
```
```
• Locate "Processors" in the filebeat.yml file and then add below attribute to get timezone of Server:
	For more information, see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/add-locale.html
	For example:-
       processors:
	 - add_locale: ~
 ```

3. To learn how to start FileBeat, see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-installation-configuration.html#start

#### For details on configuring Filebeat connection over SSL, refer [Configuring Filebeat to push logs to Guardium](https://github.com/IBM/universal-connectors/blob/main/input-plugin/logstash-input-beats/README.md#configuring-filebeat-to-push-logs-to-guardium).


### Known issues and solutions

#### Duplicate Records in Guardium for a single event.

There is a known issue when Guardium start getting multiple entries from Filebeat for a single record because of either Network or Firewall issue. 
The problem appears when Filebeat send an event to Guardium but don't get the acknowledgement back from Guardium due to connection failure/break because of Network or Firewall problem, in that scenario Filebeat treats it as failure and try to send the same event again. 

The best solution for this problem is to fix the Network/Firewall issues, but Filebeat has also provided a solution to fix this problem and that in context of Elasticsearch. [Click here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-deduplication.html) for more details.

User can also try to implement the same by adding below mention lines in Filebeat and Guardium filter configuration.

Filebeat Configuration:- 

```
* Locate "Processors" in the filebeat.yml file and then add below attribute to get unique id for each event:
	For more information, see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/add-id.html
	For example:-
        processors:
           - add_id: ~

 ```
Filter Configuration :-

```
* Add the below mentioned lines inside the filter configuration, which will replace the event_id & _id values with the unique id created by 
  Filebeat using add_id feature in Filebeat configuration.

mutate {
 replace => { "event_id" => "%{[@metadata][_id]}"}
 replace => { "_id" => "%{[@metadata][_id]}"}
}
	
 ```
 
#### Ignoring system logs using Filebeat.
There are cases when MariaDB generates few system logs which are either not required or having less information for Guardium. Such logs should be filtered
at Filebeat level only.

Filebeat provides a solution which can be implemented to ignore such logs, below are the steps
1. Open filebeat.yml in notepad or any OS specific text editor.
2. Search "filebeat.inputs" property.
3. Under the "filebeat.inputs" property, uncomment the exclude_lines property and place the query you want to ignore at the Filebeat level
4. Different third party tools may generate different system queries, so modify queries in the 'exclude line' of your Filebeat configuration as needed.
	
```
exclude_lines: ["select 1","SET autocommit","select @@version_comment","SHOW COLLATION","SELECT @@tx_isolation","select @@lower_case_table_names","SET GLOBAL","SHOW GLOBAL","COMMIT","ROLLBACK","SELECT CONCAT","FLUSH PRIVILEGES","set @@SQL_SELECT_LIMIT","SELECT TABLE_SCHEMA TABLE_CAT","@@max_allowed_packet"]
		
 ```

## 5. Configuring the MariaDB filter in Guardium
The Guardium universal connector is the Guardium entry point for native audit logs. The Guardium universal connector identifies and parses the received events, and converts them to a standard Guardium format. The output of the Guardium universal connector is forwarded to the Guardium sniffer on the collector, for policy and auditing enforcements. Configure Guardium to read the native audit logs by customizing the MariaDB template.
 
## Before you begin
* You must have permission for the S-Tap Management role. The admin user includes this role by default.
  
* MariaDB-Guardium Logstash filter plug-in is automatically available with Guardium Data Protection versions 12.x, 11.4 with appliance bundle 11.0p490 or later or Guardium Data Protection version 11.5 with appliance bundle 11.0p540 or later releases.
