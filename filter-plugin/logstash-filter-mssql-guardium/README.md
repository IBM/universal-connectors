# MSSQL-Guardium Logstash filter plug-in

This is a [Logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash) filter plug-in for the univer***REMOVED***l connector that is featured in IBM Security Guardium. It parses events and mes***REMOVED***ges from the MSSQL audit log into a [Guardium record](https://github.com/IBM/univer***REMOVED***l-connectors/blob/main/common/src/main/java/com/ibm/guardium/univer***REMOVED***lconnector/commons/structures/Record.java)  instance (which is a standard structure made out of several parts). The information is then sent over to Guardium. Guardium records include the accessor (the person who tried to access the data), the session, data, and exceptions. If there are no errors, the data contains details about the query "construct". The construct details the main action (verb) and collections (objects) involved.

This plugin is written in Ruby and so is a script that can be directly copied into Guardium configuration of Univer***REMOVED***l Connectors. There is no need to upload the plugin code. However, in order to support few features one zip has to be added named, mssql-offline-plugins-7.5.2.zip and a jar file for mssql has to be uploaded named, mssql-jdbc-7.4.1.jre8.

The plug-in is free and open-source (Apache 2.0). It can be used as a starting point to develop additional filter plug-ins for Guardium univer***REMOVED***l connector.

## 1. Configuring AWS MSSQL RDS

### Procedure

		l. To access DB from outside, select public access to yes under Connectivity section.
		m. Select create database.
	
	2. Accessing database instance from outside
	
		To access DB instance from outside we need to add inbound rule to database.
			
			a. Click on database that we created in previous step.
			b. Go to ‘Connectivity & security’ tab.
			c. Under security, click on ‘VPC security group’(which is default we selected while creating database)

			{
				"Version": "2012-10-17",
				"Statement": [
					{
						"Effect": "Allow",
						"Action": "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
						"Resource": "*"
					},
					{
						"Effect": "Allow",
						"Action": [
							"s3:ListBucket",
							"s3:GetBucketACL",
							"s3:GetBucketLocation"
						],

## 2. Enabling Auditing

	1. Connecting to database:
		
		a. Start the SQL Server Management Studio and provide connection details. Enter the ‘endpoint’ (for AWS, you will get this on AWS RDS console) as the Server Name. Provide the ‘username’ and the master ‘password’ that we had set while creating the database.
		b. Create database.

	2. About Audits:
		
		a. SQL Server audit lets you create server audits, which can contain server audit specifications for server level events, and database audit specifications for database level events.
		b. When you define an audit, you specify the location for the output of the results. This is the audit destination. The audit is created in a di***REMOVED***bled state and does not automatically audit any actions. After the audit is enabled, the audit destination receives data from the audit.

	3. Creating audit:
	
		a. Create an audit (In management studio: Security -> Audits -> New Audit)
		b. Provide file path ([D:\rdsdbdata\SQLAudit\] default for AWS RDS instance).
		c. In Maximum file size, deselect Unlimited check box and provide a value.
		d. Keep remaining configurations as is.
		e. Click on Ok button.
		f. Right click on audit that we have created and select enable to enable it.
		
	4. Create audit specifications:
	
		a. Create a server audit specification:
		
			I. In management go to Security, expand it.
			II. Right click on Server audit specification option and select New audit specification.
			III. Select Audit that we created in earlier step.
			IV. Configure Audit log groups as per requirement. (Detailed audit log groups can be found on Microsoft documentation site)
			V. Click on Ok button.
			VI. Right click on server audit specification that we have created and select enable to enable it.
			
		b. Create database audit specification:
		
			I. In management go to Database, expand it.
			II. Expand security under it.
			III. Right click on Database audit specification option and select New audit specification.
			IV. Select Audit that we created in earlier step.
			V. Configure Audit log groups as per requirement. (Detailed audit log groups can be found on Microsoft documentation site)
			VI. Click on Ok button.
			VII. Right click on database audit specification that we have created and select enable to enable it.

	5. Create audit specifications for error capture[This step is only required for OnPrem configuration]:

			I. Excute below TSQL to capture error events. 

			CREATE EVENT SESSION [<event_name>] 
			ON SERVER 
			ADD EVENT sqlserver.error_reported
			(    
				ACTION    
				(	       
					sqlserver.client_hostname,
					sqlserver.database_id,
					sqlserver.sql_text,
					sqlserver.username,
					sqlserver.database_name,
					sqlserver.session_id,
					sqlserver.server_instance_name
				)
				WHERE
				(
					[severity] >= (11)
				)
			)
			ADD TARGET package0.asynchronous_file_target
			(
				SET filename=N'<path to the xel file>'
			)
			WITH
				(
					MAX_MEMORY=4096 KB,
					EVENT_RETENTION_MODE=ALLOW_SINGLE_EVENT_LOSS,
					MAX_DISPATCH_LATENCY=30 SECONDS,
					MAX_EVENT_SIZE=0 KB,
					MEMORY_PARTITION_MODE=NONE,
					TRACK_CAUSALITY=OFF,
					STARTUP_STATE=ON
				);
			GO

			ALTER EVENT SESSION [<event_name mentioned in create event>]ON SERVER
			STATE = START;
			GO

	Kindly note event name should be ***REMOVED***me for TSQL Create and Alter event.
	And xel path name mentioned in TSQL should be matching to SQL statement mentioned in input plugin for 'failure' tag. 


#### Limitations

	• MSSQL auditing only supports error logs for following two groups:
		a. FAILED_DATABASE_AUTHENTICATION_GROUP: Indicates that a principal tried to log on to a contained database and failed. Events in this class are raised by new connections or by connections that are reused from a connection pool.
		b. FAILED_LOGIN_GROUP: Indicates that a principal tried to log on to SQL Server and failed. Events in this class are raised by new connections or by connections that are reused from a connection pool.
	• The mssql plug-in does not support IPV6.
	• For guardium version 11.4 and below, incorrect value of session start time in report is known issue.
	• Currently load balancing is not supported.
	• MSSQL error capturing is not supported for AWS MSSQL.


## 3. Configuring the MSSQL filters in Guardium

The Guardium univer***REMOVED***l connector is the Guardium entry point for native audit logs. The univer***REMOVED***l connector identifies and parses received events, and then converts them to a standard Guardium format. The output of the univer***REMOVED***l connector is forwarded to the Guardium sniffer on the collector, for policy and auditing enforcements. Configure Guardium to read the native audit logs by customizing the MSSQL template.

### Authorizing outgoing traffic from AWS to Guardium

#### Procedure
	1. Log in to the Guardium API.
	2. Issue these commands:
		• grdapi add_domain_to_univer***REMOVED***l_connector_allowed_domains domain=amazonaws.com
		• grdapi add_domain_to_univer***REMOVED***l_connector_allowed_domains domain=amazon.com

#### Before you begin

• You must have LFD policy enabled on the collector. The detailed steps can be found in step 4 on [this page](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/guardium/11.4?topic=dpi-installing-testing-filter-input-plug-in-staging-guardium-system).

• You must have permission for the S-Tap Management role. The admin user includes this role by default.

• Download the [mssql-offline-plugins-7.5.2.zip](https://github.com/IBM/univer***REMOVED***l-connectors/blob/main/filter-plugin/logstash-filter-mssql-guardium/MssqlOverJdbcPackage/mssql-offline-plugins-7.5.2.zip) plug-in.

• Download the [logstash-filter-xml.zip](https://github.com/IBM/univer***REMOVED***l-connectors/blob/main/filter-plugin/logstash-filter-mssql-guardium/MssqlOverJdbcPackage/logstash-filter-xml.zip) plug-in.[This zip is not required for AWS MSSQL]

• Download the [mssql-jdbc-7.4.1.jre8](https://jar-download.com/artifacts/com.microsoft.sqlserver/mssql-jdbc/7.4.1.jre8) jar.

#### Procedure:

1. On the collector, go to Setup > Tools and Views > Configure Univer***REMOVED***l Connector.
2. First Enable the Univer***REMOVED***l Guardium connector, if it is Di***REMOVED***bled already.
3. Click Upload File and select the offline [mssql-offline-plugins-7.5.2.zip](https://github.com/IBM/univer***REMOVED***l-connectors/blob/main/filter-plugin/logstash-filter-mssql-guardium/MssqlOverJdbcPackage/mssql-offline-plugins-7.5.2.zip) plug-in. After it is uploaded, click OK.
4. Click Upload File and select the offline [logstash-filter-xml.zip](https://github.com/IBM/univer***REMOVED***l-connectors/blob/main/filter-plugin/logstash-filter-mssql-guardium/MssqlOverJdbcPackage/logstash-filter-xml.zip) plug-in. After it is uploaded, click OK.
5. Click Upload File and select the [mssql-jdbc-7.4.1.jre8](https://jar-download.com/artifacts/com.microsoft.sqlserver/mssql-jdbc/7.4.1.jre8) jar. After it is uploaded, click OK.

6. Click the Plus sign to open the Connector Configuration dialog box.
7. Type a name in the Connector name field.
8. Update the input section to add the details from [awsMssqlJDBC.conf](https://github.com/IBM/univer***REMOVED***l-connectors/blob/main/filter-plugin/logstash-filter-mssql-guardium/MssqlOverJdbcPackage/awsMssqlJDBC.conf) for AWS MSSQL or [onPremMSSQL.conf](https://github.com/IBM/univer***REMOVED***l-connectors/blob/main/filter-plugin/logstash-filter-mssql-guardium/MssqlOverJdbcPackage/on-premMssqlJDBC.conf) for on prem MSSQL setup file's input part, omitting the keyword "input{" at the beginning and its corresponding "}" at the end.
   Note :
   • For Guardium Data Protection version 11.3, add the following line to the input section:
   'jdbc_driver_library => "${THIRD_PARTY_PATH}/mssql-jdbc-7.4.1.jre8.jar"'
   • If auditing is configured way long back and UC is configured at later point of time, still UC will process all the previous older records as well till date, since it is already audited by the DB.
9. Update the filter section to add the details from [awsMssqlJDBC.conf](https://github.com/IBM/univer***REMOVED***l-connectors/blob/main/filter-plugin/logstash-filter-mssql-guardium/MssqlOverJdbcPackage/awsMssqlJDBC.conf) for AWS MSSQL or [onPremMSSQL.conf](https://github.com/IBM/univer***REMOVED***l-connectors/blob/main/filter-plugin/logstash-filter-mssql-guardium/MssqlOverJdbcPackage/on-premMssqlJDBC.conf) for on prem MSSQL setup file's filter part, omitting the keyword "filter{" at the beginning and its corresponding "}" at the end.
10. "type" field should match in input and filter configuration section. This field should be unique for  every individual connector added.
11. If using two jdbc plug-ins on the ***REMOVED***me machine, the last_run_metadata_path file name should be different.
12. Click Save. Guardium validates the new connector, and enables the univer***REMOVED***l connector if it was
	di***REMOVED***bled. After it is validated, it appears in the Configure Univer***REMOVED***l Connector page.

## 4. JDBC Load Balancing Configuration

a. In MSSQL JDBC input plug-in,we distribute load between two machines based on Even and Odd "session_id" for "Success" events.

#### Procedure:

On First G Machine, in input section for JDBC Plugin update "statement" field in the first jdbc block where tags => ["Success"] like below:

	SELECT server_instance_name,event_time, session_id, database_name, client_ip, server_principal_name, application_name, statement, succeeded, DATEDIFF_BIG(ns, ‘1970-01-01 00:00:00.00000’, event_time) AS updatedeventtime FROM sys.fn_get_audit_file(‘E:\Deploy\SQLAudit*.sqlaudit’, DEFAULT, DEFAULT) Where schema_name not in (‘sys’) and object_name NOT IN (‘dbo’,‘syssubsystems’,‘fn_sysdac_is_currentuser_***REMOVED***’,‘backupmediafamily’,‘backupset’,‘syspolicy_configuration’,‘syspolicy_configuration_internal’,‘syspolicy_system_health_state’,‘syspolicy_system_health_state_internal’,‘fn_syspolicy_is_automation_enabled’,‘spt_values’,‘sysdac_instances_internal’,‘sysdac_instances’) and database_principal_name not in(‘public’) and ((succeeded =1) or (succeeded =0 and statement like ‘%Login failed%’ )) and statement != ‘’ and session_id%2= 0 and DATEDIFF_BIG(ns, ‘1970-01-01 00:00:00.00000’, event_time) > :sql_last_value order by event_time

On Second G Machine, in input section for JDBC Plugin update "statement" field in the first jdbc block where tags => ["Success"] like below:

	SELECT server_instance_name,event_time, session_id, database_name, client_ip, server_principal_name, application_name, statement, succeeded, DATEDIFF_BIG(ns, ‘1970-01-01 00:00:00.00000’, event_time) AS updatedeventtime FROM sys.fn_get_audit_file(‘E:\Deploy\SQLAudit*.sqlaudit’, DEFAULT, DEFAULT) Where schema_name not in (‘sys’) and object_name NOT IN (‘dbo’,‘syssubsystems’,‘fn_sysdac_is_currentuser_***REMOVED***’,‘backupmediafamily’,‘backupset’,‘syspolicy_configuration’,‘syspolicy_configuration_internal’,‘syspolicy_system_health_state’,‘syspolicy_system_health_state_internal’,‘fn_syspolicy_is_automation_enabled’,‘spt_values’,‘sysdac_instances_internal’,‘sysdac_instances’) and database_principal_name not in(‘public’) and ((succeeded =1) or (succeeded =0 and statement like ‘%Login failed%’ )) and statement != ‘’ and session_id%2= 1 and DATEDIFF_BIG(ns, ‘1970-01-01 00:00:00.00000’, event_time) > :sql_last_value order by event_time

b. In MSSQL JDBC input plug-in , we distribute load between two machines based on Even and Odd "timestamp" for "Failure" events.

#### Procedure:

On First G Machine, in input section for JDBC Plugin update "statement" field in the second jdbc block where tags => ["Failure"] like below:

	SELECT timestamp_utc,event_data,DATEDIFF_BIG(ns, ‘1970-01-01 00:00:00.00000’, timestamp_utc) AS updated_timestamp FROM sys.fn_xe_file_target_read_file(‘C:\temp\ErrorCapture*.xel’,null,null,null) where DATEDIFF_BIG(ss, ‘1970-01-01 00:00:00.00000’, timestamp_utc)%2 = 1 and DATEDIFF_BIG(ns, ‘1970-01-01 00:00:00.00000’, timestamp_utc) > :sql_last_value order by timestamp_utc

On Second G Machine, in input section for JDBC Plugin update "statement" field in the second jdbc block where tags => ["Failure"] like below:

	SELECT timestamp_utc,event_data,DATEDIFF_BIG(ns, ‘1970-01-01 00:00:00.00000’, timestamp_utc) AS updated_timestamp FROM sys.fn_xe_file_target_read_file(‘C:\temp\ErrorCapture*.xel’,null,null,null) where DATEDIFF_BIG(ss, ‘1970-01-01 00:00:00.00000’, timestamp_utc)%2 = 0 and DATEDIFF_BIG(ns, ‘1970-01-01 00:00:00.00000’, timestamp_utc) > :sql_last_value order by timestamp_utc
