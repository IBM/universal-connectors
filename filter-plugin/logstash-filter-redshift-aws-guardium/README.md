## Redshift-Guardium Logstash filter plug-in
This is a [Logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash) filter plug-in for the univer***REMOVED***l connector that is featured in IBM Security Guardium. It parses events and mes***REMOVED***ges from the AWS Redshift audit log into a [Guardium record](https://github.com/IBM/univer***REMOVED***l-connectors/blob/main/common/src/main/java/com/ibm/guardium/univer***REMOVED***lconnector/commons/structures/Record.java) instance (which is a standard structure made out of several parts). The information is then sent over to Guardium. Guardium records include the accessor (the person who tried to access the data), the session, data, and exceptions. If there are no errors, the data contains details about the query "construct". The contstruct details the main action (verb) and collections (objects) involved. In this connector we are using "PGRS" Guardium parser as well as custom parser for some scenarios. The Redshift plugin supports only Guardium Data Protection as of now.

This plug-in uses two parsers. It relies on Guardium SQL parser most of the time, while parsing some queries unique to Redshift by itself.

The plug-in is free and open-source (Apache 2.0). It can be used as a starting point to develop additional filter plug-ins for the Guardium univer***REMOVED***l connector.

 # Notes
 1. While connecting  third part tool (sqlworkbench/j), we need to add an inbound rule to the security group inside Redshift cluster
      - Navigate to the Redshift Console and click on the cluster which is created and go to properties tab.
      - In the 'Network and security settings', select the security group inside VPC security group.
      - Once the 'Security Groups' page opens, go to the Inbound rules section and click on 'Edit inbound rules'
      - Now click on 'Add rule' and provide the following details-
          1. Type : Redshift 
          2. Protocol : TCP (default)
          3. Port range: 5439 (default)
          4. Source : Custom (0.0.0.0/0)
     - Click on Save rules.

### Procedure
1. Go to the CONFIG tab in left menu panel.
2. Select Workload management and choose default parameter group. <br> Editing is di***REMOVED***bled for the default parameter group in the Parameters tab. No provision is available to edit the default parameter group so the user needs to create a new parameter group.
3. Click on the Create button.
4. Choose a name and description for the Parameter group and click 'Create'.
## Configure & Modify Parameter Group
### Procedure
After creating a new Parameter group, the user can modify the parameters
1. Open the newly created parameter group and select the Parameters tab
2. Click on 'Edit Parameters'
2. In enable_user_activity_logging ,change the value from false to true.
3. click on Save

1. Navigate to the Redshift Console and click on the cluster that you just created and go to the properties tab.
3. After opening the properties tab click on 'Edit' and select 'Edit parameter group'
4. Now select parameter group you have created and modified.
5. Click on Save changes.
## Connect to the database
### Procedure
Once the Cluster has been created, go to the properties tab

In Database configurations section, you can see the default database name is dev, default port on which AWS Redshift listens to is 5439, and the default username is awsuser.
1. Go to the EDITOR tab in the left menu panel and click on 'Connect to database'. (A new page will open)
2. Choose the created cluster name.
3. Add Database name and Database user. 
4. click on Connect.
## Execute Query
### Procedure
1. Create a table with details and append the row with the created table
2. Execute query with Run button.
## 3. Viewing the logs entries on S3 
## Procedure
Go to S3 buckets from the search box and find the details of the generated logs (UserActivity/Connection) in below format:

`s3`/<`bucket`>/<`prefix/`>/`AWSLogs/`/<`Account ID`>`redshift/`/<`region/`>/`<Year/>`/`<Month/>`/`<Day/>`/ See the generated UserActivity/Connection logs here.

## 4. Configuring the Redshift filter in Guardium
The Guardium univer***REMOVED***l connector is the Guardium entry point for native audit logs. The Guardium univer***REMOVED***l connector identifies and parses the received events, and converts them to a standard Guardium format. The output of the Guardium univer***REMOVED***l connector is forwarded to the Guardium sniffer on the collector, for policy and auditing enforcements. Configure Guardium to read the native audit logs by customizing the Redshift template.

## Authorizing outgoing traffic from AWS to Guardium
1. Log in to the Guardium API.
2. Issue these commands:
grdapi add_domain_to_univer***REMOVED***l_connector_allowed_domains domain=amazonaws.com

## Before you begin
* You must have Log Full Details policy enabled on the collector. The detailed steps can be found in step 4 on [this page](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/guardium/11.4?topic=dpi-installing-testing-filter-input-plug-in-staging-guardium-system).
* You must have permission for the S-Tap Management role. The admin user includes this role by default.
* Download the [logstash-filter-redshift_guardium_connector.zip](logstash-filter-redshift_guardium_connector.zip) plug-in.
* Download the plugin filter configuration file [redshift.conf](redshift.conf).

## Procedure
1. On the collector, go to Setup > Tools and Views > Configure Univer***REMOVED***l Connector.
2. Enable the connector if it is already di***REMOVED***bled, before proceeding to upload the UC.
3. Click Upload File and select the [logstash-filter-redshift_guardium_connector.zip](logstash-filter-redshift_guardium_connector.zip) plug-in. After it is uploaded, click OK.
4. Click the Plus sign to open the Connector Configuration dialog box.
5. Type a name in the Connector name field.
6. Update the input section to add the details from [redshift.conf](redshift.conf) file's input part, omitting the keyword "input{" at the beginning and its corresponding "}" at the end.
7. Update the filter section to add the details from [redshift.conf](redshift.conf) file's filter part, omitting the keyword "filter{" at the beginning and its corresponding "}" at the end.
8. The "type" fields should match in input and filter configuration sections. This field should be unique for every individual connector added.
9. Click Save. Guardium validates the new connector, and enables the univer***REMOVED***l connector if it was
di***REMOVED***bled. After it is validated, it appears in the Configure Univer***REMOVED***l Connector page.

## 5. Limitations
1. The log files will appear in the s3 bucket in hourly batches, and sometimes even later. A typical delay is 30-120 minutes.

2. The Following important fields couldn't be mapped with Redshift audit logs
     - Source program : Not available with User Activity/Connection logs
     - Server IP : Not available with User Activity/Connection logs
     - Client HostName : Not available with User Activity/Connection logs
     - Client IP : Not available with User Activity logs (mentioned in AWS standard document) and in case of Connection logs, it will only appear in Guardium quickSearch (QS) page.
3. Error Logs : As mentioned in the AWS standard document for Redshift Connector, UserActivity logs do not capture any error logs related with Syntax error or Authentication error. That's why we are capturing connection logs only for Authentication Failure Logs (It will be appear on Guardium QS Screen as "LOGIN_FAILED" only if failed login is attempted). 
4. Due to parser limitation, the following are the details of the changes and limitations-
    - Queries having `MINUS` operator will appear with `EXCEPT` operator in Guardium.
    - The keyword `TOP<NUMBER>` will be removed from the Select Queries.
    - Select queries with `PIVOT/UNPIVOT` will not be parsed by the Connector.
5. CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW commands appear multiple times on the S3 bucket, Guardium full SQL report and sniffer logs.
6. Any query having key constraints (primary key, foreign key, unique key) may create duplicacy in logs because they are not enforced by Amazon Redshift, as mentioned in AWS document. (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/t_Defining_constraints.html)
