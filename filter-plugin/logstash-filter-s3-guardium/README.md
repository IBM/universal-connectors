This is a [Logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash) filter plug-in for the universal connector that is featured in IBM Security Guardium. It parses S3 database events into a Guardium record instance (which is a standard structure made out of several parts). The information is then sent over to Guardium. Guardium records include the accessor (the person who tried to access the data), the session, data, and exceptions. If there are no errors, the data contains details about the query "construct". The construct details the main action (verb) and collections (objects) involved. 

The plug-in is free and open-source (Apache 2.0). It can be used as a starting point to develop additional filter plug-ins for Guardium universal connector.

## Filter notes
* The filter supports events sent through Cloudwatch or SQS.

## 4. Exporting Cloudwatch Logs to SQS using lambda function
In order to achieve load balancing of audit logs between different collectors, the audit logs must be exported
from Cloudwatch to SQS.

### Creating the SQS queue
The SQS created in these steps will contain the messages to be filled up by the lambda function
(created in next section) in the queue by reading the CloudWatch logs. The messages inside the SQS will
contain content from CloudWatch logs.

**_Procedure_**
1. Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/
2. Click **Services**
3. Search for SQS and click on **Simple Queue Services**
4. Click **Create Queue**.
5. Select the type as **Standard**.
6. Enter the name for the queue

**_Procedure_**
1. Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/
2. Go to **IAM service** > **Policies** > **Create Policy**.
3. Select **service as SQS**.
4. Check the following checkboxes:  **ListQueues**, **DeleteMessage**, **DeleteMessageBatch**, **GetQueueAttributes**,
   **GetQueueUrl**, **ReceiveMessage**, **ChangeMessageVisibility**, **ChangeMessageVisibilityBatch**.
5. In the resources, specify the ARN of the queue created in the above step.
6. Click **Review policy** and specify the policy name.
7. Click **Create policy**.
8. Assign the policy to the user
    1. Log in to the IAM console as an IAM user (https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).
    2. Go to **Users** on the console and select the relevant IAM user to whom you want to give permissions.
       Click the **username**.
    3. In the **Permissions tab**, click **Add permissions**.
    4. Click **Attach existing policies directly**.
    5. Search for the policy created and check the checkbox next to it.
    6. Click **Next: Review**
    7. Click **Add permissions**

### Creating the Lambda function
The Lambda function will read the CloudWatch Logs and send the events into the SQS queue.
Follow the steps below to configure the Lambda function.

#### Creating IAM Role
Create the IAM role that will be used in the Lambda function setup. The AWS Lambda service will require permission to
log events and write to the SQS created. Create the IAM Role **Export-Redshift-CloudWatch-to-SQS-Lambda** with
"AmazonSQSFullAccess", "CloudWatchLogsFullAccess", and "CloudWatchEventsFullAccess" policies.

__*Procedure*__
1. Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/
2. Go to **IAM** -> **Roles**
3. Click **Create Role**
4. Under use case select **Lambda** and click **Next**
5. Search for **AmazonSQSFullAccess** and select it
6. Search for **CloudWatchLogsFullAccess** and select it
7. Search for **CloudWatchEventsFullAccess** and select it
8. Set the Role Name: e.g., "Export-Redshift-CloudWatch-Logs-To-SQS" and click **Create role**.

### Create the lambda function

__*Procedure*__
1. Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/
2. Go to **Services**. Search for **lambda function**.
3. Click **Functions**
4. Click **Create Function**
5. Keep **Author for Scratch** selected
6. Set Function name e.g., Export-S3-CloudWatch-Logs-To-SQS
7. Under **Runtime**, **select Python 3.x**
8. Under **Permissions**, select **Use an existing role** and select the IAM role that you created in
   the previous step (Export-S3-CloudWatch-to-SQS-Lambda)
9. Click **Create function** and navigate to **Code view**
10. Add the function code from the file [s3Lambda.py](S3OverSQSUsingLambdaPackage/s3Lambda.py)
11. Click **Configuration** > **Environment Variables**
12. Create 2 variables:
    1. Key = GROUP_NAME value = e.g., uc-s3-plugin-cloudwatch-group
    2. Key = QUEUE_NAME value = e.g., https://sqs.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/1111111111/np-s3-sqs
13. Save the function
14. Click on the **Deploy** button

#### Automating the lambda function
The Lambda will be called by a scheduler configured inside event rules in CloudWatch.

**_Procedure_**
1. Go to the CloudWatch dashboard.
2. Go to **Events** > **Rules**.
3. Click **Create Rule**.
4. Enter the name for the rule e.g., cloudwatchToSqs
5. Under **Rule Type**, select **Schedule**.
6. Define the schedule. In **schedule pattern**, select a schedule that runs at a regular rate,
   such as every 10 minutes.
7. Enter the rate expression, meaning the rate at which the function should execute.
   This value must match the time specified in the lambda function code that calculates the time delta.
   (If the function code it is set to 2 minutes, set the rate to 2 minutes unless changed in the code). Click **Next**.
8. Select **Target1**. Select the **Target Type** as **AWS Service**.
9. Select **Target** as **Lambda Function**.
10. Select the lambda function created in the above step. e.g., Export-S3-CloudWatch-to-SQS-Lambda.
11. Add the tag if needed.
12. Click Create Rule.

#### Note
Before making any changes to the lambda function code, first disable the above rule.
Deploy the change and then re-enable the rule.

To authorize outgoing traffic from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to Guardium, run these APIs:
```
grdapi add_domain_to_universal_connector_allowed_domains domain=amazonaws.com
grdapi add_domain_to_universal_connector_allowed_domains domain=amazon.com
```

## 5. Configuring the universal connector in Guardium

### Before you begin

       ![Connector configuration 2](/docs/images/cloudwatch/connector_configuration_2.png)

4.  Note :To configure SQS on AWS, follow the steps mentioned in the [SQS input plug-in](/input-plugin/logstash-input-sqs/README.md) readme file.</br>

    If the audit logs are to be fetched from S3 directly,
    1. Select **Amazon S3 using SQS** in **Connector template**.

       ![Connector configuration 3](/docs/images/cloudwatch/connector_configuration_3.png)

    2. Fill in the queue name and relevant details

       ![Connector configuration 4](/docs/images/cloudwatch/connector_configuration_4.png)

5. If the audit logs are to be fetched from SQS LAMBDA,
    1. Use the details from the [s3-over-sqs.conf](S3OverSQSPackage/S3/S3OverSQS.conf) file.
       Update the input section to add the details from the corresponding file's input part, omitting the
       keyword "input{" at the beginning and its corresponding "}" at the end. More details on how to configure the
       relevant input plugin can be found [here](../../input-plugin/logstash-input-cloudwatch-logs/README.md).
    2. Use the details
       from the [s3-over-sqs.conf](S3OverSQSPackage/S3/S3OverSQS.conf) file. Update the filter section to add the details
       from the corresponding file's filter part, omitting the keyword "filter{" at the beginning and its corresponding "}"
       at the end. More details on how to configure the relevant input plugin can be
       found [here](../../input-plugin/logstash-input-cloudwatch-logs/README.md).

6. The "type" fields should match in the input and the filter configuration sections. This field should be unique for every individual connector added. This is no longer required starting v12p20 and v12.1.
7. Click **Save**. Guardium validates the new connector, and enables the universal connector if it was
   disabled. After it is validated, it appears in the Configure Universal Connector page.
