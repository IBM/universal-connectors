# BigQuery-Guardium Logstash filter plug-in
### Meet BigQuery
* Tested versions: V2
* Environment: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* Supported inputs: Pub/Sub (pull)
* Supported Guardium versions:
    * Guardium Data Protection: 11.4 and above

This is a [Logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash) filter plug-in for the universal connector that is featured in IBM Security Guardium. It parses a GCP (Google Cloud Platform) event logs into a [Guardium record](https://github.com/IBM/universal-connectors/blob/main/common/src/main/java/com/ibm/guardium/universalconnector/commons/structures/Record.java) instance (which is a standard structure made out of several parts). The information is then sent over to Guardium. Guardium records include the accessor (the person who tried to access the data), the session, data, and exceptions. If there are no errors, the data contains details about the query "construct". The construct details the main action (verb) and collections (objects) involved. As of now, the BigQuery plug-in only supports Guardium Data Protection.

### Note
This plug-in contains a runtime dependency of Logstash Google PubSub input plug-in (version ~> 1.2.1, i.e. at least 1.2.1).

This version is compliant with Guardium Data Protection v11.4 and above. Please refer to the [input plug-in repository](https://github.com/IBM/universal-connectors/tree/main/input-plugin/logstash-input-google-pubsub) for more information.

## Configuring BigQuery on GCP
### BigQuery Setup
1. [Prerequisites](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-cloud-console)
2. BigQuery is automatically enabled in new projects. To activate BigQuery in an existing project, enable the BigQuery API.  Please refer to [Enable the BigQuery API](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery-transfer/docs/enable-transfer-service#creating_a_project_and_enabling_the_api) for more information.
3. Create a BigQuery dataset that stores the data.
  Please refer to [Create a Dataset](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/datasets) for more information
4. Create a table
    - Expand the: View actions option and click ```Open```.
    - In the details panel, click on (+) Create table.
    - On the Create table page, do the following:
Enter Table Name. e.g., “user”.
You can add more fields to the table by clicking  ```+Add Field```.
    - Click ```Create Table```.
Please refer to [Create Table](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/tables) for more information
5. Query table data. Please refer to [Query Table Data](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-cloud-console#query_table_data) for more information

### Permissions and Roles Details

##### Grant Permission Required for log view/ download

User can view and download the generated logs.
The following Identity and Access Management roles are required to view and download logs:

* To view logs:
roles/logging.viewer (Logs Viewer)
roles/logging.privateLogViewer (Private Logs Viewer)
* To download logs:
roles/logging.admin (Logging Admin)
roles/logging.viewAccessor (Logs View Accessor)

### Create a log sink in Pub/Sub
* In the Cloud Console, go to the Logging > Log Router page.
* Click ```Create sink```.
* In the Sink details panel, enter the following details:
* Sink name: Provide an identifier for the sink. Note that after you create the sink you cannot rename it. However, you can delete a sink and create a new one.
* Sink description (optional): Describe the purpose or use case for the sink.
* In the Sink destination panel, select the Pub/Sub topic as sink service and destination.
* Choose logs to include in the sink in the Build inclusion filter panel.
* You can filter the logs by log name, resource, and  severity.
Multi-region
* In cases of multiple regions, you need to do the same set of configurations per each region.
Based on the region, different configuration files will be used for the input plug-in

#### Set destination (TOPIC & SUBSCRIPTION) permissions

To set permissions for the log sink to route to its destination, do the following:
* Obtain the sink's writer identity—an email address—from the new sink.
   1. Go to the Log Router page, and select ```menu```  > ```View sink details```.
   2. The writer identity appears in the Sink details panel.
* If you have owner access to the destination:
   1. add the sink's writer identity to topic and give it the Pub/Sub Publisher role and subscriber role.
   2. add the sink's writer identity to subscription and give it the Pub/Sub subscriber role.
   3. 
## Viewing the Audit logs

The inclusion filter mentioned above will be used to view the Audit logs in the GCP Logs Explorer.

### Supported audit logs
  1. BigQueryAudit - `ACTIVITY`, `DATA_ACCESS` logs
  2. BigQuery Log - `EMERGENCY`, `ALERT`, `CRITICAL`, `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `NOTICE`, `DEBUG`, `DEFAULT`

## 4. Limitations
1. If no information regarding certain fields is available in the logs, those fields will not be mapped. 
2. Exception object will be prepared based on severity of the logs.
3. The data model size is limited to 10 GB per table. If you have a 100 GB reservation per project per location, BigQuery BI Engine limits the reservation per table to 10 GB. The rest of the available reservation is used for other tables in the project.
4. BigQuery cannot read the data in parallel if you use gzip compression. Loading compressed JSON data into BigQuery is slower than loading uncompressed data.
5. You cannot include both compressed and uncompressed files in the same load job.
6. JSON data must be newline delimited. Each JSON object must be on a separate line in the file.
7. The maximum size for a gzip file is 4 GB.
8. Log messages have a size limit of 100K bytes
9. The Audit/Data access log doesn't contain a server IP. The default value is set 0.0.0.0 for the server IP.
10. The following important fields cannot be mapped, as there is no information regarding these fields in the logs:
    - Source program 
    - OS User
    - Client HostName 
11.  `serverHostName` pattern for BigQuery GCP :
project-id_bigquery.googleapis.com.
12. When you try to create or delete a data set or table using BigQuery UI options, fields like the FULL SQL & Objects and Verbs column appear blank, because these actions don't receive any query from GCP logs. You can ignore these actions, by updating the inculsion filter:
"(resource.type=("bigquery_project") AND protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail:* AND
(protoPayload.metadata.jobChange.job.jobStatus.jobState = DONE AND -protoPayload.metadata.jobChange.job.jobConfig.queryConfig.statementType = "SCRIPT"))"
13. The parser does not support queries in which a keyword is used as a table name or column name, or in scenarios of nested parameters inside functions.
14. The BigQuery audit log doesn’t include login failed logs, so these will not appear in the guardium LOGIN_FAILED report.

## Configuring the BigQuery filter in Guardium
The Guardium universal connector is the Guardium entry point for native audit/data_access logs. The Guardium universal connector identifies and parses the received events, and converts them to a standard Guardium format. The output of the Guardium universal connector is forwarded to the Guardium sniffer on the collector, for policy and auditing enforcements. Configure Guardium to read the native audit/data_access logs by customizing the BigQuery template.

### Before you begin
* Configure the policies you require. See [policies](/docs/#policies) for more information.
* You must have permission for the S-Tap Management role. The admin user includes this role by default
* Download the relevant plugin based on the version of the Guardium.
