## Contributing In General
Our project welcomes external contributions. To contribute code or documentation, please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/IBM/logstash-filter-mongodb-guardium/pulls).

A good way to familiarize yourself with the codebase and contribution process is
to look for and tackle low-hanging fruit in the  [issue tracker][issues].

### Proposing new features

If you would like to implement a new feature, like a utility or helper functions, please [raise an issue][issues] before sending a pull request so the feature can be discussed. This is to avoid
you wasting your valuable time working on a feature that the project developers
are not interested in accepting into the code base.

### Fixing bugs

If you would like to fix a bug, please [raise an issue][issues] before sending a
pull request so it can be tracked.

### Merge approval

The project maintainers use LGTM (Looks Good To Me) in comments on the code
review to indicate acceptance. A change requires LGTMs from two of the
maintainers of each component affected.

For a list of the maintainers, see the [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) page.

## Legal

Each source file must include a license header for the Apache
Software License 2.0. Using the SPDX format is the simplest approach.
For example: 

```
/*
Copyright <holder> All Rights Reserved.
SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
*/
```

We have tried to make it as easy as possible to make contributions. This
applies to how we handle the legal aspects of contribution. We use the
same approach - the [Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)][DCO] - that the LinuxÂ® Kernel [community](https://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin)
uses to manage code contributions.

We simply ask that when submitting a patch for review, the developer
must include a sign-off statement in the commit message.

Here is an example Signed-off-by line, which indicates that the
submitter accepts the DCO:

```
Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
```

You can include this automatically when you commit a change to your
local git repository using the following command:

```
git commit -s
```

## Communication
Feel free to [create an issue][issues] to question or discuss anything with us. For more general questions regarding Guardium, we also refer you to the [IBM Security Guardium community][Guardium community].

## Testing
For the meantime, you can manually test this library as follows: 
1. Follow the How to use section in [README.md]
2. Build a GEM from your plugin
3. Install the GEM onto your local Logstash.
4. Run Logstash with a configuration that tests your filter, and verify there are no errors and Record is generated as expected. 
5. Prepare an offline pluging pack from this filter, then upload & install it onto a staging Guardium collector and test data flows OK. Note that in order to install this filter onto a Guardium collector, you will need to rename the filter name and its package.
