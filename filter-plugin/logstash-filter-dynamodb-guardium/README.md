# Amazon DynamoDB-Guardium Logstash filter plug-in
### Meet DynamoDB
* Tested versions: 2019.11.21
* Environment: AWS
* Supported inputs: CloudWatch (pull)
* Supported versions:
    * Guardium Data Protection: 11.4 and above
    * Guardium Insights: 3.2 and above

This is a [Logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash) filter plug-in for the univer***REMOVED***l connector that is featured in IBM Security Guardium. It parses events and mes***REMOVED***ges from the Amazon DynamoDB audit log into a [Guardium record](https://github.com/IBM/univer***REMOVED***l-connectors/blob/main/common/src/main/java/com/ibm/guardium/univer***REMOVED***lconnector/commons/structures/Record.java) instance (which is a standard structure made out of several parts). The information is then sent over to Guardium. Guardium records include the accessor (the person who tried to access the data), the session, data, and exceptions. If there are no errors, the data contains details about the query "construct". The construct details the main action (verb) and collections (objects) involved.

The plug-in is free and open-source (Apache 2.0). It can be used as a starting point to develop additional filter plug-ins for Guardium univer***REMOVED***l connector.

## 1. Configuring Amazon DynamoDB

In the AWS web interface, configure the service for Dynamodb.

### Procedure

	1. Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/:

		f) Enter a table name
		g) Enter a partition key
		h) Scroll down and click the orange <Create table> button

## 2. Enabling audit logs 

There are different ways for auditing and logging. We will use CloudTrail for this example since it supports all required parameters. The below events are supported for auditing in AWS

### Supported Events

    1. UpdateTable event
    2. CreateTable event
    3. DescribeTable event
    4. ListTables event
    5. DeleteTable event
    6. Error event

### Procedure

    1. Click Services in the top left menu.
	2. Underneath <All services>, click on <Management & Governance>
	3. On the right panel, click <Cloud Trail>
	4. Click <Create trail> button
	5. Provide a trail name under <Trail name>
	6. Under <Storage location>, verify "Create new S3 bucket" is selected
	7. Under <Log file SSE-KMS encryption>, uncheck the Enabled box
	8. Under <CloudWatch Logs>, check the Enabled box
	9. Verify (x)New is selected under <Log group>
	10. Under <Log group name>, provide a new log group name
	11. Verify (x)New is selected under <IAM Role>
	12 Under <Role name>, provide a new role name
	13. Click the orange [Next] button at the lower right
	14. Under Event type, select [x] Management events and [x] Data events
	15. Verify [x]Read and [x]Write is selected under API Activity
	16. In the <Data Events> section, click the [Switch to basic event selectors] button
	17. Click [Continue] to confirm button.
	18. Verify <Data event source> is S3
	19. Uncheck the []Read and []Write boxes next to <All current and future S3 buckets>
	20. Next to the [Browse] button under <Individual bucket selection>, ensure that both Read and Write boxes are selected
	21. Click [Add data event type] button
	22. Click the <Data event source> dropdown and select "DynamoDB"
	23. Click the orange [NEXT] button
	24. Verify all parameters shown are correct.
	25. Click the orange [Create trail] button

## 3. Viewing the logs on CloudWatch

### Procedure

	1. Click the Service drop down.
	2. On right <Recently visited> panel, click on CloudWatch
	3. On the left panel, click on Logs
	4. Click on <Log groups> under Logs
	5. In the search box, enter the name of the log group created in the previous STEP 9.
	6. Click on the log group that appeared from the search
	7. All logs will appear under log streams in the format: <account_i>_CloudTrail_<region>

### Limitations

	The dynamodb plug-in does not support IPV6.

## 4. Configuring the Dynamodb filters in Guardium

The Guardium univer***REMOVED***l connector is the Guardium entry point for native audit logs. The univer***REMOVED***l connector identifies and parses received events, and then converts them to a standard Guardium format. The output of the univer***REMOVED***l connector is forwarded to the Guardium sniffer on the collector, for policy and auditing enforcements. Configure Guardium to read the native audit logs by customizing the dynamodb template.

### Authorizing outgoing traffic from AWS to Guardium

#### Procedure

	1. Log in to the Guardium Collector's APIs.
	2. Issue these commands:
		• grdapi add_domain_to_univer***REMOVED***l_connector_allowed_domains domain=amazonaws.com
		• grdapi add_domain_to_univer***REMOVED***l_connector_allowed_domains domain=amazon.com
#### Before you begin

•  Configure the policies you require. See ([policies](/../../#policies)) for more information.
.

• You must have permission for the S-Tap Management role. The admin user includes this role by default.

• Download the [dynamodb-offline-plugins-7.5.2.zip plug-in.](https://github.com/IBM/univer***REMOVED***l-connectors/blob/main/filter-plugin/logstash-filter-dynamodb-guardium/DynamodbOverCloudwatchPackage/DynamoDB/dynamodb-offline-plugins-7.5.2.zip)


### Procedure

1. On the collector, navigate to Setup > Tools and Views > Configure Univer***REMOVED***l Connector
2. First enable the Univer***REMOVED***l Guardium connector, if it is di***REMOVED***bled already
3. Click Upload File and select the offline plug-in named [dynamodb-offline-plugins-7.5.2.zip plug-in.](https://github.com/IBM/univer***REMOVED***l-connectors/blob/main/filter-plugin/logstash-filter-dynamodb-guardium/DynamodbOverCloudwatchPackage/DynamoDB/dynamodb-offline-plugins-7.5.2.zip). After it is uploaded, click OK.
4. Click the Plus sign to open the Connector Configuration dialog box
5. Type a name in the Connector name field.
6. Update the input section to add the details from the [dynamodbCloudwatch.conf](https://github.com/IBM/univer***REMOVED***l-connectors/blob/main/filter-plugin/logstash-filter-dynamodb-guardium/dynamodbCloudwatch.conf) file's input part, omitting the keyword "input{" at the beginning and its corresponding "}" at the end
7. Update the filter section to add the details from the [dynamodbCloudwatch.conf](https://github.com/IBM/univer***REMOVED***l-connectors/blob/main/filter-plugin/logstash-filter-dynamodb-guardium/dynamodbCloudwatch.conf) file's filter part, omitting the keyword "filter{" at the beginning and its corresponding "}" at the end
8. The "type" fields should match in the input and the filter configuration sections. This field should be unique for every individual connector added.
9. Click Save. Guardium validates the new connector, and enables the univer***REMOVED***l connector if it was di***REMOVED***bled. After it is validated, it appears in the Configure Univer***REMOVED***l Connector page

## Configuring the dynamodb filters in Guardium Insights

To configure this plug-in for Guardium Insights, follow [this guide.](https://github.com/IBM/univer***REMOVED***l-connectors/blob/main/docs/UC_Configuration_GI.md)

In the input configuration section, refer to the CloudWatch_logs section.
