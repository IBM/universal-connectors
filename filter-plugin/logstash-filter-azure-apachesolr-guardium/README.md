# Apache Solr Azure-Guardium Logstash filter plug-in

### Meet Apache Solr Azure
* Tested versions: 8.6.0
* Environment: Azure
* Supported inputs: Filebeat (push)
* Supported Guardium versions:
  * Guardium Data Protection: 11.4 and above
  * Guardium Insights SaaS: 1.0

This is a [Logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash) filter plug-in for the universal connector that is featured in IBM Security Guardium. It parses events and messages from the Apache Solr logs into a [Guardium record](https://github.com/IBM/universal-connectors/blob/main/common/src/main/java/com/ibm/guardium/universalconnector/commons/structures/Record.java) instance (which is a standard structure made out of several parts). The information is then sent over to Guardium. Guardium records include the accessor (the person who tried to access the data), the session, data, and exceptions. If there are no errors, the data contains details about the query "construct". The construct details the main action (verb) and collections (objects) involved.The Apache Solr Azure plugin only supports Guardium Data Protection as of now.

The plug-in is free and open-source (Apache 2.0). It can be used as a starting point to develop additional filter plug-ins for Guardium universal connector.

## Viewing the Apache Solr logs

Go to the Solr dashboard. Under **Java Properties**, search for solr.​log.​dir

To view logs, go to **Location**:

* When Solr runs in Standalone mode - /var/solr/logs/solr.log<br>
* When Solr runs in SolrCloud mode<br>
 -/opt/solr-8.6.0/example/cloud/node1/logs/solr.log<br>
 -/opt/solr-8.6.0/example/cloud/node2/logs/solr.log<br>
 -/opt/solr-8.6.0/example/cloud/node3/logs/solr.log<br>
 -/opt/solr-8.6.0/example/cloud/node4/logs/solr.log<br>

## 3. Configuring Filebeat to push logs to Guardium

## a. Filebeat installation

### Procedure:

To install Filebeat on your system, follow the steps in this topic:
    https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-installation-configuration.html#installation

## b. Filebeat configuration:

To use Logstash to perform additional processing on the data collected by Filebeat, we need to configure Filebeat to use Logstash. To do this, modify the filebeat.yml file which you can find inside the folder where filebeat is installed. Follow these instructions for finding the installation directory:
    https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/directory-layout.html

In addition, events are configured with the include_lines, exclude_lines, and add_tags. You can learn more about Filebeat Configuration [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-input-log.html#:~:text=include_lines%20edit%20A%20list%20of%20regular%20expressions%20to,the%20list.%20By%20default%2C%20all%20lines%20are%20exported.).

### Procedure:

1. Configuring the input section :

    • Locate "filebeat.inputs" in the filebeat.yml file, then add the following parameters.

            filebeat.inputs:
            - type: log
            enabled: true
            paths:
              - /var/solr/logs/solr.log
              - /opt/solr-8.6.0/example/cloud/node1/logs/solr.log
              - /opt/solr-8.6.0/example/cloud/node2/logs/solr.log
              - /opt/solr-8.6.0/example/cloud/node3/logs/solr.log
              - /opt/solr-8.6.0/example/cloud/node4/logs/solr.log
			  
	• To include logs that are the result of RequestHandler, LogUpdateProcessorFactory, HttpSolrCall, and Exceptions in Solr.
	
            include_lines: ['o.a.s.u.p.LogUpdateProcessorFactory','o.a.s.c.S.Request','o.a.s.h.RequestHandlerBase org.apache.solr.common.SolrException','o.a.s.s.HttpSolrCall','o.a.s.c.a.c.OverseerCollectionMessageHandler','o.a.s.c.s.i.s.ExceptionStream','o.a.s.h.SQLHandler','o.a.s.h.e.ExportWriter','o.a.s.h.StreamHandler']
            exclude_lines: ['status=400']

    • To process multi-line audit events, add the settings in the same inputs section.

            multiline.type: pattern
            multiline.pattern: '^[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}'
            multiline.negate: true
            multiline.match: after
  
    • Add the tags to uniquely identify the ApacheSolr events from the rest.    
      
            tags: ["apache_solr_on_azure"]

2. Configuring the output section:-

    • Locate "output" in the filebeat.yml file, then add the following parameters.

    • Disable Elasticsearch output by commenting it out.

    • Enable Logstash output by uncommenting the Logstash section. For more information, see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/logstash-output.html#logstash-output

    For example:
            output.logstash:
	      hosts: ["20.115.120.146:5085"]

    • The hosts option specifies the Logstash server and the port (5001) where Logstash is configured to listen for incoming Beats connections.

    • You can set any port number except 5044, 5141, and 5000 (as these are currently reserved in Guardium v11.3 and v11.4 ).

## 4. Configuring the ApacheSolr filter in Guardium

The Guardium universal connector is the Guardium entry point for native audit logs. The Guardium universal connector identifies and parses the received events, and converts them to a standard Guardium format. The output of the Guardium universal connector is forwarded to the Guardium sniffer on the collector, for policy and auditing enforcements. Configure Guardium to read the native audit logs by customizing the Solr template.

### Before you begin

* Configure the policies you require. See [policies](/docs/#policies) for more information. 
* You must have permission for the S-Tap Management role. The admin user includes this role by default.

* Download the [guardium_logstash-offline-plugin-apache-solr-azure.zip](https://github.com/IBM/universal-connectors/releases/download/v1.5.0/logstash-filter-apache_solr_azure_connector.zip) plug-in. (Do not unzip the offline-package file throughout the procedure). This step is not necessary for Guardium Data Protection v12.0 and later.
  
### Procedure


1. On the collector, go to Setup > Tools and Views > Configure Universal Connector.
2. Enable the universal connector if it is disabled.
3. Click Upload File and select the offline [guardium_logstash-offline-plugin-apache-solr-azure.zip](https://github.com/IBM/universal-connectors/releases/download/v1.5.0/logstash-filter-apache_solr_azure_connector.zip) plug-in. After it is uploaded, click OK. This step is not necessary for Guardium Data Protection v12.0 and later.
4. Click the Plus icon to open the Connector Configuration dialog box.
5. Type a name in the Connector name field.
6. Update the input section to add the details from the [solrazure.conf](solrazure.conf) file's input part, omitting the keyword "input{" at the beginning and its corresponding "}" at the end.
7. Update the filter section to add the details from the [solrazure.conf](solrazure.conf) file's filter part, omitting the keyword "filter{" at the beginning and its corresponding "}" at the end.
8. The 'type' fields should match in the input and filter configuration sections. This field should be unique for every individual connector added.
9. The tag added in the filebeat.yml file should match the "[tags]" specified in the filter part.
10. Click Save. Guardium validates the new connector and displays it in the Configure Universal Connector page..

## 5. Limitations    
- The following important fields couldn't be mapped with ApacheSolr qtp logs:
  - SourceProgram : field is left blank, as this information is not embedded in the messages pulled from Azure.<br>
  - clientIP : field is populated with 0.0.0.0, as this information is not embedded in the messages pulled from Azure.<br>
  - OS User         : Not available with logs<br>
  - Client HostName : Not available with logs<br>
  - dbUser          : Not available with logs<br>
  - LOGIN_FAILED    : Not available with logs

- While launching Solr in SolrCloud mode, multiple logs will be generated for single query execution as a call to shard(In SolrCloud, a logical partition of a single Collection) and replica(A core that acts as a physical copy of a shard in a SolrCloud Collection). 

## 5. Configuring the Apache Solr filters in Guardium Insights
To configure this plug-in for Guardium Insights, follow [this guide.](/docs/Guardium%20Insights/3.2.x/UC_Configuration_GI.md)
For the input configuration step, refer to the [Filebeat section](/docs/Guardium%20Insights/3.2.x/UC_Configuration_GI.md#Filebeat-input-plug-in-configuration).
